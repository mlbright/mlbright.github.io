<h1>mlbright.github.io</h1>
<p>Martin-Louis Bright's <a href="https://mlbright.github.io/">public site</a> website.
This was a failed attempt at writing a blog.
The entries are still available in the <a href="https://github.com/mlbright/mlbright.github.io/tree/main/writing">writing</a> directory.
I will infrequently update the site with new content.</p>
