If a PDF document has a password, it can be handy to remove that password permanently.

On MacOS,

1. Open the document in the Preview app.
1. Enter the password.
  ![Document with password](/doc-with-password.png "document with password")
1. From the Preview menu, Select File > Print.
1. Select the PDF dropdown, and save the document.
1. The resulting new document will not have a password.
  ![Save without password](/print-pdf-without-password.png "document without password")
